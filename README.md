# Run Tracker Frontend

Simple web interface for tracking running activities.

## Features
- Display all runs in a table
- View statistics (all-time, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- [Coming soon: Add, edit, delete runs]

## Tech Stack
- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML5 / CSS3
- Fetch API for REST calls

## Setup
1. Ensure backend is running on `localhost:8080`
2. Open `index.html` in browser
3. That's it!

## API Endpoints Used
- `GET /runs` - Fetch all runs
- `GET /runs/stats` - All-time statistics
- `GET /runs/stats/week` - Weekly stats
- etc.

## What I Learned
- Async/await and Promises
- DOM manipulation
- Event listeners and callbacks
- fetch API
